## About Myself :\

Hi, I'm Sketchy Bach and I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for developing CyberSecurity tools . Connect with me on [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yarin-suisa) to discuss cybersecurity, job opportunities, or just to say hi! This project is a showcase of my skills in Python,and network knowledge. 

## Disclaimer : The code of this tool was tweaked at the end with an ai tool to make it look better , it was written completely by me and not written by it. 


## Requirements : 

- **Operating System**: Linux (e.g., Kali Linux recommended)
 **Dependencies**: netcat : (sudo apt install netcat)


## Installation :

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SketchyBach/BannerGrabbing.git
   cd BannerGrabbing


   
2. Debian Based environment download:

Download via ZIP file and unzip
sudo apt update
sudo apt install netcat
sudo chmod +x port_scanner.sh

##Notice : 
Legal Use: Only scan systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
Limitations: The banner grabbing feature works best with services that respond to basic HTTP requests . Some services may require custom commands.
